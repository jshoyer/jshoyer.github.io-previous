Already I am annoyed by the Nature content sharing thing.
I don't want links to PDFs, I want full text HTML.
I guess it is better than a link to pubmed or the abstract page.

Link was in this article:
http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/02/business/energy-environment/a-gray-area-in-regulation-of-genetically-modified-crops.html?_r=0

As an aside, I like the word 'transgenic' better than GM or GE.
(Article says
"Genetically engineered crops, popularly called genetically modified
organisms or G.M.O.s",
but neither of those seem as formal (or precise) to me).
'Engineered' would be fine, but it seems like biotech
isn't much of a formal engineering discipline yet.
