Yes sir.

... statistical topics are usually less private. Indeed, even when a
topic is highly personal, a statistical framing can provide some
comfortable emotional distance.
#+END_QUOTE

I hadn't considered that before, but it makes sense.

Writing entries in org-mode should streamline things.
Clumsy aspect: have to manually reexport and commit output file.
Untitled sections show up as a plain pound sign when exported from
org-mode to markdown.

Timestamps.
They alter indentation/paragraph flow.
Or do they?

*** The default font size for headings is gigantic.

Also they make things more complicated.

Dear statistical diary,

Sudden influx of Karl Broman posts.
Was there something funny with his RSS feed or Gwene?
Anyway, motivation to work on
[[https://kbroman.wordpress.com/2014/12/03/the-value-of-thesis-introdiscussion/][lit review]].

I like Karl's phrase:
'Ye Olde Standard Computational Science Practice'.
Picturing early computational scientists with tricornered hats ringing bells.
(They use emacs, of course).

Technology grating, as usual.
RSS and email clients.
Journal websites.
(Repeated clicks to get to full text,
versioning/failure to retypeset articles after correction.)
Extra clicks to get to
Lubinski et al. (next link)
supplemental material
via an issue-wide page!
Ye Olde Web Technology?

OK, I should get to work.
Need to provide some return on the

** Thinking out loud (teaching)

Dear statistical waitress,

Andrew today:
"I’m going to go lighter on the traditional sampling topics (ratio
and regression estimation, stratified cluster sampling bla bla bla)
and instead have them do Mister P for real in R and Stan, just like
the grownups do."

"No fear of dead time."
Savor the awkward pauses!
Same advice that STM gave for running paper discussions.
Sort of.

Just why exactly does he like Stan so much?

What standardized test score data is publicly available?

Reading ARM this morning.
"... literature is full of confusing and contradictory advice."
[2015-01-09 09:56]

I should really take time to enjoy stats,
not worry so much about accomplishing things.

** Trying to use org-babel.  Give up for now.

Hmm.  I don't like the org-babel documentation today.

Why do I need the TIKz device?

R-pie example says:
Error: could not find function ".ess.eval"
Problem with ESS changes?

** Article on Brad Perez (Potti lab researcher)

New details on the Potti case published yesterday in The Cancer Letter.
I agree with Arthur Caplan:
“The medical student was very brave. That was quite an act of courage."
# I didn't realize he had moved.

Strong words from Donald Berry:
 ‘Commenting on education, the problem is really who are the
 educators. The senior scientists are the problem. They are not the
 solution. And...young statisticians are just as clueless as the
 senior scientists.’

*** Misc

"The memo shows that, by ignoring the content of the Perez memo,
Duke’s deans allowed Nevins to investigate his protégé himself."
Which protégé?  Potti?

Cancer Letter site annoying (big flash videos, ads), and article spread
across four pages.  Clean up and combine.
Don't understand scripts in header,
or what causes the big non-loading nonlinking block.

Static Header: delete entire thing.
portletBodyHTML has much junk.
Delete big issuu iframes.  I see now that they were intended to be
embedded documents.  Whatever.

** Rereading

Reread Bob's post on Michael Jordan interview article.
Sounds like the journalist did everything they should.

Revisit The Statistical Significance Filter: If an estimate is
statistically significant, it’s probably an overestimate.
(Gelman and Weakliem 2009).
Confusing language elsewhere: "necessarily an overestimate".
I don't remember where.

Poincaré.

shepik commented on May 12, 2012

"I love it that you can easily know just by
looking at word wraps of the comment
whether a person is supporting Linus or not


Andrew says:
"And all this “statistically significant but not practically
significant” talk can completely lead us astray, by leading us to be
wary of very small estimates, while what we should really be
suspicious of, is very large estimates!"

Makes sense.

I am sorry that I don't have an RSS feed.
I like RSS as a technology.

I like Gwene,
but a problem is going to send me to thunderbird
: A feed with this internal ID (http://www.sciencedirect.com) is already subscribed as gwene.com.sciencedirect.ecological.modeling.latest.content.

I agree that git is a bad fit for scientists.
