Yes sir.

... statistical topics are usually less private. Indeed, even when a
topic is highly personal, a statistical framing can provide some
comfortable emotional distance.

I hadn't considered that before, but it makes sense.

Writing entries in org-mode should streamline things.
Clumsy aspect: have to manually reexport and commit output file.
Untitled sections show up as a plain pound sign when exported from
org-mode to markdown.

Timestamps.
They alter indentation/paragraph flow.
Or do they?

*** The default font size for headings is gigantic.

Also they make things more complicated.

Dear statistical diary,

Sudden influx of Karl Broman posts.
Was there something funny with his RSS feed or Gwene?
Anyway, motivation to work on
[[https://kbroman.wordpress.com/2014/12/03/the-value-of-thesis-introdiscussion/][lit review]].

I like Karl's phrase:
'Ye Olde Standard Computational Science Practice'.
Picturing early computational scientists with tricornered hats ringing bells.
(They use emacs, of course).

Technology grating, as usual.
RSS and email clients.
Journal websites.
(Repeated clicks to get to full text,
versioning/failure to retypeset articles after correction.)
Extra clicks to get to
Lubinski et al. (next link)
supplemental material
via an issue-wide page!
Ye Olde Web Technology?

OK, I should get to work.
Need to provide some return on the

in my research and education.

Dear statistical waitress,

Andrew today:
"Iâ€™m going to go lighter on the traditional sampling topics (ratio
and regression estimation, stratified cluster sampling bla bla bla)
and instead have them do Mister P for real in R and Stan, just like
the grownups do."

"No fear of dead time."
Savor the awkward pauses!
Same advice that STM gave for running paper discussions.
Sort of.

Just why exactly does he like Stan so much?

What standardized test score data is publicly available?

Reading ARM this morning.
"... literature is full of confusing and contradictory advice.
