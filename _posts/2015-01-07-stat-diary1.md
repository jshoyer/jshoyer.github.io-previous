I hadn't considered that before, but it makes sense.

Writing entries in org-mode should streamline things.
Clumsy aspect: have to manually reexport and commit output file.
Untitled sections show up as a plain pound sign when exported from
org-mode to markdown.

Timestamps.
They alter indentation/paragraph flow.
<span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">[2015-01-07 15:25]</span></span>

# The default font size for headings is gigantic.

Also they make things more complicated.
