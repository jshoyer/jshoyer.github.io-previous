Zotero is great.
[Infinite storage] is cheap!
I hope that someday there will be lots of active groups sharing
interesting reading.
(These currently need to be semi-private---you can't share attachments
in fully public groups that anyone can join).
Here is my [profile].

Zotero could get even better if I find better ways to use it with
[Zotelo] in emacs or figure out better ways to [integrate] it with the
firefox omnibar, the file system, etc.
(I would bookmark attachments, but can't because every attachment gets
a number, and the numbers aren't consistent across machines.
It's also laborious to make symlinks to each attachment for a paper,
because each attachment is stored in a separate directory with a
gibberish name.  BibDesk might work better for this.)

In case you missed it below, here again is my [ORCID page].
I am orc number 0000-0002-1338-8900.
