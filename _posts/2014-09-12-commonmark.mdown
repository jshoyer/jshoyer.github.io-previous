I don't like Markdown.
I hope CommonMark will improve consistency.
My previous post renders fine in their
'[dingus](http://jgm.github.io/stmd/js/)'
but not on this jekyll site/blog,
because it has a '.mdown' extension.
I found this strange because the
[first example/test post](https://github.com/nhoss2/jekyll-bootstrap/blob/gh-pages/_posts/2011/2011-08-03-first-post.mdown)
ends in '.mdown'.
However, that post doesn't have any links.
