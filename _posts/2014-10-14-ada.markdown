  [FAQ](http://findingada.com/about/faq/)

I'll try to write some more thoughts about Rosalind Franklin
(and perhaps Barbara McClintock---I'm surprised no one has written
about her this year).
I'm sorry I can't yet be bothered to actually the syntax for markdown links.
Pull requests welcome.

Pedantic note: Rosalind technically didn't use crystallography to
study DNA---she used fiber diffraction.

In my biochemistry class there was a great demonstration of how Photo
51-style diffraction diagrams suggested the helical nature of DNA.
I wish I could still remember the optics.
I'm nearly certain that the lesson used the kit at the top of
[this page](http://ice.chem.wisc.edu/Catalog/SciKits.html).
[This article](http://homepages.ius.edu/kforinas/P105/PTE000140.pdf)
also seems relevant.

Incidentally, there was also a great multiweek somewhat
crystallography-related lab project in that class.
The published [description](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/ed8000842)
is behind a paywell, sadly.  Really ACS?

I think we can all agree that Nobel prizes awarded to one to three
people are no longer a good way to recognize scientific achievents.
Maybe they never were.
See [Zimmer] (2011).

Someone [wrote] about Dorothy Hodgkin this year---sweet.  I'd like to learn more
about her.  I see that my library has a biography on her.
And maybe she wrote a forward to a book on the SDI/"Star wars"?
Always a fun topic.

I recently read some of a book on
'Why aren't more women in science?'
([Google book link.](http://books.google.com/books?id=e7XaAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_ViewAPI).)
I liked the empiricism.

I resolve to actually write and submit a blog post to the Ada site
next year.  Hopefully this site will be a little more stable by then
and/or may have an RSS feed.
Or perhaps I will have sworn off of github because of the allegations
of sexism or something.

Thoughts of STM remind me that Bonnie Bassler is a seriously awesome
scientist.  I saw her speak almost exactly eight years ago and it
still stands out to me as one of the best talks I've ever seen.

Incidentally, I like the fact that most of the photos on the chem
[department web site] are over five years old.  I like seeing the people
who were there when I was!
