I'll try to write some more thoughts about Rosalind Franklin
(and perhaps Barbara McClintock---I'm surprised no one has written
about her this year).
I'm sorry I can't yet be bothered to actually the syntax for markdown links.
Pull requests welcome.

Pedantic note: Rosalind technically didn't use crystallography to
study DNA---she used fiber diffraction.

I think we can all agree that Nobel prizes awarded to one to three
people are no longer a good way to recognize scientific achievents.
Maybe they never were.
See Zimmer (2011).

Someone wrote about Dorothy Hodgkin this year---sweet.  I'd like to learn more
about her.  I see that my library has a biography on her.
And maybe she wrote a forward to a book on the SDI/"Star wars"?
Always a fun topic.

I recently read some of a book on
'Why aren't more women in science?'

I liked the empiricism.

I resolve to actually write and submit a blog post to the Ada site
next year.  Hopefully this site will be a little more stable by then
and/or may have an RSS feed.
Or perhaps I will have sworn off of github because of the allegations
of sexism or something.
