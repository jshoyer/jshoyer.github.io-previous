I'll try to write some more thoughts about Rosalind Franklin
(and perhaps Barbara McClintock---I'm surprised no one has written
about her this year).

Pedantic note: Rosalind technically didn't use crystallography to
study DNA---she used fiber diffraction.


I think we can all agree that Nobel prizes awarded to one to three
people are no longer a good way to recognize scientific achievents.
Maybe they never were.

Someone wrote about Dorothy Hodgkin this year---sweet.  I'd like to learn more
about her.
