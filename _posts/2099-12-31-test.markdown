Attention conservation notice:
I am a graduate student.
Half-baked ideas may appear here.
I don't recommend linking or bookmarking the pages---they will
probably go away, and they certainly won't be stable or historically
accurate.

See New Yorker cartoon: cave man steps out of time machine.
"I have come from the future---to warn you that nothing much changes
in the next 100 years."

<!-- Commentary:
     people expect github user page,
     therefore should have one.
     I should really watch 'Back to the Future' again.  And the sequels.
