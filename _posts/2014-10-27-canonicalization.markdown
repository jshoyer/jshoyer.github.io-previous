I'd like to learn more about SEO.
I'm curious:
how does google index URLs that get resolved, e.g. DOI links?
I googled that question.
This [post](http://go-to-hellman.blogspot.com/2010/05/long-handle-on-shortened-digital-object.html)

Seems like the old 'canonization' would have worked fine.
Sounds more dignified, less technical.

One of my two publications has the word 'canonical' in the title.
Maybe not the most informative word for nonexperts.
Someday the protein I spent so much time purifying and cooking will
join the canon of classic small heat shock proteins.

I do not like the word proxy,
when people say "...as a proxy for...".
