Post title named after recent post where *x* = `R`
that various ecologists linked to.
See links in previous post.
See also the random git man page generator.
See also the emacs listserve
for some really hilarious comments

trying to understand strange and subtle git terminology.

Irony of centralization yadda yadda yadda&#x2026;

DO enforce ISO 8601 as a standard.
