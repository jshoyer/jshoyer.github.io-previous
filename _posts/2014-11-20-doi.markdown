links from
ScienceDirect sidebars include strings like "&zone=rightPane&panel=workspace",
which breaks DOI lookup.
What ridiculous carelessness.

They also seem to have changed something that breaks fulltext lookup
with NCBI eutils.

All of this forces me to click with my mouse several times more per day.
Infuriating.
