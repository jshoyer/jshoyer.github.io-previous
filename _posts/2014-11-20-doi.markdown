title: Elsevier broke their DOI redirection---that is rude

CrossRef
links from
ScienceDirect sidebars include strings like "&zone=rightPane&panel=workspace",
which breaks DOI lookup.
What ridiculous carelessness.

They also seem to have changed something that breaks fulltext lookup
with NCBI eutils.
(I wouldn't need to use eutils [via emacs] if crossref DOI lookup took
you straight to the fulltext, instead of the abstract.
Presumably if more publishing was more open and less PDF-centric I
wouldn't have this problem.)

On the plus side, I don't have to use proxy login to get to
ScienceDirect nearly as much as I used to---many more papers are
"Open Archived".
The benefit of public deposition in pubmed central!
They want the traffic and the ad revenue.

All of this forces me to click with my mouse several times more per day.
Infuriating.

Update [2014-12-03 17:36]:
you can't report this stuff to CrossRef,
because the "DOI" isn't valid.

That is precisely the problem!
